# Whiteboard
Created a realtime whiteboard using vanilla javascript, HTML, CSS and canvas API. Used Socket.io and node events to reflects back realtime changes to multiple users. Created Undo- Redo features for the board using arrays as a stack by storing positions colours and width of pen and eraser.
